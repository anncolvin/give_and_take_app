Ruby 2.3.0

App Name: Give and Take

I just started building this app so there isn't much to see yet! The purpose of this app is to more efficiently leverage our existing networks to share resources and expertise. 


Here are a few basic user stories that I'm starting with: 

I want to show a list of items (min 0 and max 5) that I currently need. These items could be anything: help learning excel, a referral to a great barber, or a garden tool that I want to borrow for a weekend.

I want to show a list of items (min 0 and max 5) that Iâ€™m currently willing to share which my network may find useful. Again, these items could be pretty much anything. 

I want to choose who sees these lists.

I want to know if an individual already has lists available to me. I may or may not want to share my lists only with those that are already participating and willing to share their lists with me.


I'm hoping to add these features once I have the basic app working:

A standard easy way to indicate that you want to get something offered or want to give something requested. 

Network tiers with lists assigned to each tier (certain items may only be visible to a defined network tier). 

See a listing and ratio of items given vs. gotten for each of my connections.
